  <h1 class="header">Hello Nikith!</h1>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "w" on it is called the tom tom. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "a" on it is also a tom tom and sounds lower (lower pitch). Some people have only one tom and others prefer two. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "s" on it is called the floor tom. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "d" on it is another floor tom (nobody has two but this is just for fun). </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "j" on it is called the snare drum and is used for things like drum rolls. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "k" on it is called the crash. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The drum with the letter "l" on it is called the bass drum which creates a loud, booming, deep sound. </p>
<p class="fun explanation">For a cool beat, try hitting k & l at the same time, then just k, then j & k at the same time, then just k again. Then you can add in some cool solos (called fills in drums) by using w, a, s, and d!</p>
